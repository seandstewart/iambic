## Parsing Text
`iambic` relies upon a set of standard style tokens for parsing text.
For an in-depth breakdown of what each detected node means, check out
[How It Works](../how-it-works.md).

## Tokens

### Headings
Act, Scene, Epilogue, Prologue, and Intermission sections should be
wrapped in heading tokens. (`#...` for Markdown,
`<h(1-...)>...</h(1-...)>` for HTML). i.e.:
    
    ## ACT I
    
    <h1>ACT I</h1>
    
    ## SCENE II. The same.
    
    <h2>SCENE II. The same.</h2>



### Bolded
**Bolded Text** is significant, and is considered a character name,
i.e.:
    
    **HAMLET**
    
    <b>HAMLET</b>
    
    **First Soldier**
    
    <b>First Soldier</b>

### Italics
_Italicized text_ is also significant - it signals that everything
enclosed within the block is a character action or stage direction.
`iambic` will mark any italicized text that is also enclosed within
brackets as stage actions and associate the action to the last-seen
character when building the tree.

    // Stage 'Direction'
    _Alarum._
    *Alarum.*
    <i>Alarum.</i>
    
    // Character 'Action'
    _[Aside]_
    *[Aside]*
    <i>[Aside]</i>
    
As a bonus, `iambic` also attempts to detect 
    
Multi-line blocks are also supported, as in plain markdown.


### Ellipsis
Ellipses (either `â€¦` or `...`) indicate the beginning and end of a
"shared" line of poetry, i.e.:

    **MALCOLM**
    Say to the king the knowledge of the broil  
    As thou didst leave it. ...
    
    **Sergeant**  
    ... Doubtful it stood;  
    As two spent swimmers, that do cling together  

`As thou didst leave it. .../... Doubtful it stood;` scan as a single
line of iambic pentameter. The `...` at the end of a line will signal
to `iambic` that we are now entering a continuation of the same line.
`iambic` will track the continuation until the next line fails to
start or end with a `...`. 

`iambic` will also track the owner of every shared line and increment
their own count of spoken lines. This will not, however, increment the
total number of lines in a given play. `iambic` will not increment
again until it detects it has exited the continuation.

    
### All Other Text
Any non-tokenized text will be marked as a single line of dialogue and
associated to the last character seen.


## Examples

```
>>> import iambic
>>> import json
>>> play = """
... ## ACT I
... ## SCENE I. A field.
...
... _Enter FOO from one side, BAR from another._
...
... **FOO**
... Bar. ...
...
... **BAR**
... ... Foo!
...
... _Exeunt, severally_
... """
...
>>> parsed = iambic.parse.text(play, title="Foo")
>>> print(parsed.json)

## Parsing JSON
Iambic is equipped to load valid JSON documents into the ast. For
instance:

```python
>>> iambic.parse.data("""{
...      "type":"persona",
...      "index":3,
...      "text":"FOO",
...      "name":"Foo",
...      "short":null
...    }""")
Persona(type=<NodeType.PERS: 'persona'>, index=3, text='FOO', name='Foo', short=None)
```

Nested data is also handled without any additional work.
